C# Basics Practice – Conditional Logic & Switch Statements

This project contains a collection of small C# console programs designed to practice **conditional logic**, **user input handling**, and **switch statements**. Each section demonstrates a different beginner-friendly programming challenge.

Features:
Larger Number Checker

Prompts the user for two integers and outputs whether they are equal or which one is larger.

Discount Calculator

Calculates a 10% discount on orders over £100 and displays the updated total.

Traffic Light System

Simulates a traffic light response using simple conditional logic (red/amber/green).

Student Grade Evaluator

Assigns a grade (Fail, Pass, Merit, Distinction) based on a numeric exam score between 0–100.

Vowel or Consonant Checker (Switch Statement)

Uses a switch statement to determine whether a character is a vowel, consonant, or invalid input.

Purpose

This project is part of my ongoing learning in **C# fundamentals**—focusing on reading user input, working with conditionals, and understanding how to structure beginner console applications.

How to Run

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the project in Visual Studio or VS Code
